O my Luve is like a red, red rose.   
   That’s newly sprung in June;    
O my Luve is like the melody    
   That’s sweetly played in tune.   
So fair art thou, my bonnie lass,    
   So deep in luve am I;    
And I will luve thee still, my dear,    
   Till a’ the seas gang dry.    
Till a’ the seas gang dry, my dear,    
   And the rocks melt wi’ the sun;    
I will love thee still, my dear,    
   While the sands o’ life shall run.    
And fare thee weel, my only luve!    
   And fare thee weel awhile!    
And I will come again, my luve,    
   Though it were ten thousand mile.
